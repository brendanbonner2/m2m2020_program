# MCM PRACTICUM

Storage reporistory for completed Masters of AI practicum for DCU.

The project creates a cloud based public data reporitory for mutable and immutable recordings
of machine learning model signatures. A python library allows the python notebook or keras application
to automatically generate and update fingerprints through the lifecycle of a machine learning MLOps or
deployment lifecycle (as well as an optimised synopsis of the model to show differences between validated
models.
