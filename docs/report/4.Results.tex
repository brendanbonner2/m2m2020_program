\section{Results and Discussion}
This section includes presentations of the data and results in graphical and/or tabular form. Statistical analysis of the variation in measurements/results can also be presented. The findings should be explicitly related to the stated objectives of the project. Details and tasks that that may distract the reader unnecessarily should be presented in Appendices.

This is the section where you have a chance to discuss the results and draw conclusions from them - i.e. where you show your ability to think analytically about your findings.

Results are:

\subsection{Reduction in size for model identification}
