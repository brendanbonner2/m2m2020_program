\section{Background}

Models in CNNs are the primary reason for opacity of neural networks. Decision
trees and algortihms have the benefit of being easily repeatable outside of the
system. The complexity of even the simplest models makes this unviable. 
The introduction usually describes the background of the project with brief information on general knowledge of the subject. This sets the scene by stating the problem being tackled and what the aims of the project are.
