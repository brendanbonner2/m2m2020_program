\begin{abstract}
Artificial Intelligence is built on trustworthiness of the systems that provide the intelligence.
The bedrock of these are models that have been trained in a particular manner to generate outcomes that replicate, or improve, the training inputs. To ensure that models used by AI practitioners are verifiable and traceable, we propose to investigate if we can validate models generated by machine learning systems, and generate a trace ability path between deployed models and the initial training, or pretrained models if transfer learned.
