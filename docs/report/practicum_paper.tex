\begin{abstract}
Artificial Intelligence is built on trustworthiness of the systems that provide the intelligence. The foundation of this is built upon our understanding of the role of software models in this process. Similar to measuring social trust in humans, we can only increase our levels of trust by being exposed to the full competence and vulnerabilities of the environment to get to the point in time where trust can be assessed. The pathway for the human brain to grow and evolve is recorded in genealogy, education and experience. In this paper, we investigate feasibility and benefits for replicating this process for machine learning systems. During this process, we create an ecosystem where AI systems can have their entire lifecycle recorded and made available for scrutiny. The framework for a secure chain of provenance of the lifecycle of artificial intelligence systems may be a first step into addressing shortcomings in AI research which potentially could stymie innovation for certain critical systems from being deployed. The outcome of the research cannot coerce trust, although it provides additional insight into comparing aspects of a software models \textit{personality}, without needed to directly examine every neuron.
